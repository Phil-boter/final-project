# final-project/EL JEFFE

El JEFFE will help you, when you stand in the supermarket still not knowing what to eat or cook 
by searching online for shopping lists and recipes.
If everything fails it also has an implemented restaurant search for the nearest restaurant of your choice.

## About
    I built this project during my attendance to the Coding Bootcamp at Spiced Academy's in Berlin.

    At the homepage the user can search for shoppinglists. It is also possible to make an user account. 
    If the user sign in, it is possible to reset the password. 
    Setting up an user account has the benefit of having a more detailed shoppinglist 
    and the restaurant search.
    It is also possible to store and delete favorite shoppinglists. 
    Finally the user can decide to logout or to delete the account.
    Two different server side API calls are made for the search functionality.
